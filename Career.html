        <h3> His Starting Career:</h3>

        <p>
            He began playing football at age 8,
            when he joined amateur youth team <span>Andorinha.</span>
            In 1995, he signed with the local club
            <span> Nacional,</span> and was then signed by
            <span>Sporting CP.</span>
            He started playing soccer when he was
            <span>9 years old.</span>
            At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a <span>heart condition.</span>
            He needed surgery, but he was sidelined only
            briefly and made a full recovery.
            Ronaldo debuted on Sporting Clube de Portugal's first team
            in <span>2002.</span> As a child, Ronaldo played for
            <span>Andorinha from 1992 to 1995</span>,
            where his father was the kit man,
            and later spent two years with Nacional.
        </p>

        <img src="images/SportingLisbon.png" title="Sporting Lisbon" alt="Sporting Lisbon">

        <p>
            In <span>1997, aged 12,</span> he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP,
            who signed him for a fee of <span>£1,500.</span>
            His first professional debut was on
            <span>20 August 2003, against Kazakhstan.</span>
            His position as a player was <span>Forward</span> in the match.
            His career turning point was in <span>2004 -2005 Season</span>
            of the FA cup final, he scored <span>4 goals against Arsenal</span>
            while playing for the Manchester United.
            Ronaldo began his <span>senior career</span> with Sporting CP,
            before signing with Manchester United in 2003,
            winning the FA Cup in his first season.
        </p>

        <img src="images/Lisbon.jpg" title="Sporting Lisbon" alt="Sporting Lisbon">

        <p>
            At age 23 he won his <span>first Ballon d'Or.</span>
            Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most
            expensive association football transfer
            when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth <span>€94 million (£80 million).</span>
            He became a key contributor and formed an attacking
            trio with <span>Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale</span>
            which was integral to the team winning
            four Champions League wins from <span>2014 to 2018.</span>
            During this period, he won back-to-back
            Ballons d'Or in <span>2013 and 2014,</span>
            and again in <span>2016 and 2017,</span>
            and was runner-up three times behind
            <span>Lionel Messi,</span> his perceived career rival.
            He also became the club's all-time
            <span>top goalscorer</span> and the
            all-time top scorer in the <span> Champions League,</span>
            and finished as the competition's top scorer
            for six consecutive seasons between <span>2012 and 2018.</span>
            With Real Madrid, Ronaldo won <span>four Champions Leagues,
                two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super
                Cups and three Club World Cups.
            </span>

        <p>
            In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth
            an initial <span>€100 million (£88 million)</span>,
            the most <span>expensive transfer</span> for an Italian club and
            for a player over <span>30 years old.</span>
            He won <span>two Serie A titles,</span>
            <span> two Supercoppa Italiana</span>
            trophies and a <span>Coppa Italia,</span> became the inaugural
            Serie A <span>Most Valuable Player</span> and
            became the first footballer to finish as <span>top scorer
                in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.</span>

        <h3>English Professional Football Club</h3>

        <h2><span>Manchester United</span></h2>



        <p>

            <img src="images/Manchester United.png" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

            At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's
            youth team by first-team manager
            <span>Laszlo Boloni,</span>
            who was impressed with his <span> dribbling.</span>
            He subsequently became the <span>first player to</span>
            play for the club's
            <span>under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams,</span>
            the B team and the first team, all within a single season.
            Manchester United manager 'Alex Ferguson'
            was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
            after Sporting defeated United 3-1 at the
            inauguration of the Estadio Jose Alvalade in <span>August 2003.</span>
            Initially, Manchester United had planned to
            <span>sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.</span>
            Having been impressed by him, the
            Manchester United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game,
            Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting
            <span>£12.24 million</span>
            for what he considered to be
            <span>"one of the most exciting young players"</span>
            he had ever seen.
            A decade after his departure from the club,
            in <span>April 2013</span>, Sporting honoured Ronaldo
            by selecting him to become their <span>100,000th member.</span>
            Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was
            completed on <span>12 August 2003,</span>
            and made him the <span>
                first Portuguese player
                to sign for the club.
            </span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/united6.jpg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            His transfer fee made him, at that time,
            the <span>most expensive teenager in English football history.</span>
            Ronaldo scored his <span>first goal</span> for
            Manchester United with a <span>free-kick</span> in
            a 3-0 win over Portsmouth on <span>1 November.</span>
            Three more league goals followed in
            the second half of the campaign,
            the last of which came against Aston Villa
            on the final day of the season,
            a match in which he also received the
            <span>'first red card'</span>
            of his career.
            Ronaldo ended his first season in
            English football by scoring the opening goal
            in United's 3-0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final,
            earning his <span>first trophy</span>.
            Ronaldo scored United's <span>1,000th Premier
                League goal on 29 October 2004.</span>
            Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football,
            the Football League Cup,
            after scoring the third goal in United's <span>
                4-0 final win over Wigan Athletic.</span>
            Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted
            in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006-07 season,
            it proved to be his breakout year,
            as he broke the <span>'20-goal barrier'</span> for
            the first time and won his <span>'first Premier League title'.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/united1.jpeg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            An important factor in this success was his
            <span>one-to-one training</span> by first-team coach
            <span>Rene Meulensteen,</span>
            who taught him to make himself more unpredictable,
            improve his teamwork,
            call for the ball and capitalise on
            goalscoring opportunities rather than
            waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically
            pleasing goals for which he was already known.
            He scored <span>three consecutive braces</span>
            at the end of December,
            against Aston Villa <span>(a win that put United on top of the league).</span>
            Ronaldo was named the <span>Premier League Player of the Month</span>
            in November and December,
            becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.
            He also helped Manchester United reach the <span>2007 FA Cup Final</span>,
            but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1-0 defeat.
            Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club),
            as United won their
            <span>'first league title in four years'.</span>
            As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season.
            He won the <span>Professional Footballers Association (PFA) Player's Player award,</span>
            <span>'Fans Player'</span> and
            <span>'Young Player of the Year awards',</span>
            as well as the
            <span>Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,</span>
            becoming the
            <span> "First player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours".</span>
            His wages were raised to <span>£120,000</span>
            a week as part of a five-year contract extension.
            Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaka for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kaka and Lionel Messi,
            in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.

        <img src="images/united2.jpg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            Ronaldo scored his <span>first hat-trick for Manchester United</span>
            in a 6-0 win against Newcastle United on <span>12 January 2008</span>,
            which put <span>United top of the league table.</span>
            On <span>19 March,</span> he captained Manchester United
            for the first time in a home win over Bolton and
            scored both goals in a <span>2-0 win.</span>
            His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign,
            surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967-68 season,
            setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.
            His <span>31 league goals</span> earned him the
            <span>Premier League Golden Boot,</span>
            as well as the <span>European Golden Shoe,</span>
            which made him the first winger to win the latter award.
            He additionally received the <span>PFA Player,</span>
            Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the
            <span>second consecutive season.</span>
            United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on
            <span>21 May,</span> where,
            despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser
            and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,
            United emerged <span>victorious 1-1, winning the penalties 6-5.</span>
            As the <span>Champions League top scorer,</span>
            Ronaldo was named the <span>UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/MU7.jpg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            Ronaldo scored a total of <span>42 goals</span>
            in all competitions during the <span>2007-08 season,</span>
            his most prolific campaign during his time in England.
            Ahead of the 2008-09 season,on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent
            <span>ankle surgery</span> which kept him out
            of action for <span>10 weeks.</span>
            Following his return, he scored his <span>100th goal</span>
            in all competitions for United with
            the first of two free kicks in a 5-0 win against Stoke City on
            <span>15 November,</span>
            which meant he had now
            <span>scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.</span>
            At the close of 2008,Ronaldo helped United win the <span>2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,</span>
            assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.
            With his <span>2008 Ballon d'Or</span> and
            <span>2008 FIFA World Player of the Year,</span>
            Ronaldo became United's
            <span>first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,</span>
            and the
            <span>first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/MU3.jpg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto,
            a <span>40-yard strike,</span>
            earned him the inaugural <span>FIFA Puskas Award,</span>
            presented by FIFA in recognition of the
            <span>'Best Goal Of The Year'.</span>
            He later called it the <span>'best goal he had ever scored'.</span>
            United advanced to the final in Rome,
            where he made little impact in United's 2-0 defeat to Barcelona.
            Ronaldo ended his time in England with <span>'Nine Trophies',</span>
            as United claimed their third successive <span>'League Title'</span>
            and a <span>'Football League Cup'.</span>
            He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions,
            16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.
            His <span>final goal for United came on 10 May 2009
                with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford</span>.
            Ahead of the 2009-10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid.

        <img src="images/MU4.jpg" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">

        <p>
            On <span>27 August 2021</span>,
            Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement
            with Juventus to <span>re-sign Ronaldo,</span> subject to
            agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.
            The transfer was for an initial <span>£12.85 million,</span>
            with a <span>two-year contract plus an optional year,</span>
            and was confirmed on <span>31 August.</span>
            Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after
            Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.
            The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales
            was reported to have broken the all-time record
            following a transfer, overtaking Messi after
            his move to Paris Saint-Germain.
            On <span>2 December,</span> Ronaldo netted
            two goals in a 3-2 home league
            win against Arsenal, which saw him
            surpass <span>800 career goals.</span>
            On <span>23 April,</span> he scored his
            <span>100th Premier League goal</span> in a 3-1 defeat to Arsenal.
            After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea
            and Brentford, he was named the
            <span>Premier League Player of the Month for April.</span>
            On <span>22 November</span>, Ronaldo's contract was
            terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.
            On <span>30 December 2022,</span> Saudi club <span>Al Nassr</span>
            reached an agreement
            for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023,
            signing a contract <span>until 2025.</span>

            The <span>2009-10 season</span>, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a <span>world record transfer
                fee</span> at the time of <span>£80 million (€94 million)</span>. His contract,
            which ran until 2015, was worth <span>€11 million per year</span> and contained
            a <span>€1 billion buy-out clause.</span> At least 80,000 fans attended
            his presentation at the <span>Santiago Bernabeu,</span> surpassing the 25-year
            record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed <span>Diego Maradona at Napoli.</span>
            Since club captain Raul already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United),
            Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,
            which was presented to him by former Madrid player <span>Alfredo Di Stefano.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM1.jpg" title="Real Madrid" alt="Real Madrid">

        <p>
            Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against
            <span>Deportivo La Coruna</span> on 29 August,
            scoring a penalty in a 3-2 home win.
            He scored in each of his first four league games,
            the <span>first Madrid player</span> to do so.
            His first Champions League goals for the club
            followed with two free kicks in the first group match against
            <span>Zurich.</span>
            His strong start to the season was
            interrupted when he suffered an
            <span>ankle injury in October</span>
            while on international duty,
            which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.
            A week after his return, he received his
            <span>first red card in Spain in a match against Almeria.</span>
            Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in
            the <span>2009 Ballon d'Or</span>
            and the <span>2009 FIFA World Player of the Year</span> awards, behind Messi.
            He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions,
            including a hat-trick in a 4-1 win against <span>Mallorca</span> on 5 May 2010,
            his first in La Liga, and became Real Madrid's
            <span>highest goalscorer that season.</span>
            Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league,
            he <span>did not win a trophy</span> in his first season.
            Following Raul's departure,
            Ronaldo was given the <span>number 7</span> shirt for
            Madrid before the 2010-11 season.
            Scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute
            of the <span>2011 Copa del Rey Final,</span>
            winning his <span>first trophy in Spain.</span>
            His two goals in the last match of the season against Almeria
            made him the <span>first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.</span>
            In addition to the <span>Pichichi Trophy,</span>
            Ronaldo won the <span>European Golden Shoe</span>
            for a second time, becoming the
            <span>first player</span> to win the award in different leagues.
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM2.jpg" title="Real Madrid" alt="Real Madrid">

        <p>
            Ronaldo found greater team success in the league,
            helping Madrid win their first <span>league title</span>
            in four years with a record <span>100 points.</span>
            Following a hat-trick against Levante
            as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,
            he scored his <span>100th league goal</span> for
            Madrid in a 5-1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012,
            a milestone he reached in just 92 matches
            across three seasons, breaking the previous
            club record held by <span>Ferenc Puskas.</span>
            Another hat-trick in the <span>Madrid derby</span>
            against <span>Atletico Madrid</span> brought his total to
            <span>40 league goals,</span>
            equalling his record of the previous season.
            His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca,
            took his total to 46 goals,
            four short of the new record set by Messi,
            though he became the <span>first player</span> to score
            against all <span>19 opposition teams</span>
            in a single <span>La Liga season.</span>
            Ronaldo began the <span>2012-13 season</span> by
            lifting the <span>2012 Supercopa de Espana,</span>
            his <span>third trophy in Spain.</span>
            After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties,
            against Deportivo, he scored his first
            <span>hat-trick in the Champions League</span>
            in a 4-1 win over <span>Ajax.</span>
            Four days later, he became the
            first player to score in
            <span>six successive Clasicos</span>
            when he hit a brace in a 2-2 draw at <span>Camp Nou.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM3.jpg" title="Real Madrid" alt="Real Madrid">

        <p>
            The 2012-13 winter break,
            Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match,
            scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4-3 win over
            Sociedad on 6 January.
            He subsequently became the
            <span>first Non-Spanish player</span> in 60 years
            to captain Real Madrid in <span>El Clasico</span> on 30 January,
            a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.
            Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal
            as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.
            He scored his <span>200th goal</span>
            for Madrid on 8 May in a 6-2 win against Malaga,
            reaching the landmark in <span>197 games.</span>
            He helped Madrid reach the
            <span> 2013 Copa del Rey Final</span>
            by scoring twice in <span>El Clasico,</span>
            which marked the <span>sixth successive match at Camp Nou</span>
            in which he had scored, a club record.
            In the final, he headed the opening goal of an
            eventual 2-1 extra time defeat to Atlético,
            but was shown a red card for violent conduct.
            In the first knockout round of the Champions League,
            Ronaldo faced his former club
            <span>Manchester United</span> for the first time.
            After scoring equaliser in a 1-1 draw at home,
            he scored winning goal in a 2-1
            win on his first return to Old Trafford.
            He did not celebrate scoring against his
            former club as <span>mark of respect.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM4.jpg" title="Real Madrid" alt="Real Madrid">

        <p>
            At the start of the 2013-14 season,
            Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his
            stay by three years to 2018,
            with a salary of <span>€17 million</span> net,
            making him briefly the
            <span>one of the highest-paid player in football.</span>
            By late November, Ronaldo had scored
            <span>32 goals in 22 matches</span>
            for both club and country,
            including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.
            He ended 2013 with
            <span>69 goals in 59 appearances</span>,
            his highest year-end goal tally.
            Together with striker Karim Benzema,
            they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed <span>"BBC"</span>,
            an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano.
            He received the <span>2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or</span> and
            <span>FIFA World Player of the Year award.</span>
            for the first time in his career.
            In the <span>Copa del Rey,</span> Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final
            by scoring two penalties against <span>Atletico</span>
            at the <span>Vicente Calderon,</span> the first player scored
            in <span>every single minute</span> of a 90-minute football match.
            His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final,
            where <span> Madrid</span> defeated <span>Barcelona</span> 2-1 to claim the trophy.
            Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the
            <span>Pichichi</span> and the <span>European Golden Shoe,</span>
            receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker <span>Luis Suarez.</span>
            Among his haul was his <span>400th career goal,</span>
            in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace
            against <span>Celta Vigo</span> on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot <span>Eusebio,</span>
            who had died two days before. A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against <span>Valencia</span>
            on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the <span>best goal</span>
            of the season by the <span>Liga Nacional de Futbol Profesional,</span>
            which additionally named Ronaldo the <span>Best Player in La Liga.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM5.jpeg" title="Copa del Rey" alt="Copa del Rey">

        <p>
            During the 2014-15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of
            <span>61 goals,</span> starting with both goals in Madrid's 2-0 win over
            <span>Sevilla</span> in the <span>UEFA Super Cup.</span>
            His record <span>23rd La Liga hat-trick,</span>
            scored against <span>Celta Vigo</span> on 6 December,
            made him the fastest player to reach <span>200 goals in La Liga,</span>
            reaching the milestone in 178th matches. After winning the 2014
            <span>FIFA Club World Cup,</span> Ronaldo received the <span>2014 Ballon d'Or,</span>
            joining <span>Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini</span> and
            <span>Marco van Basten</span> as a three-time recipient.
            On 5 April, he scored <span>five goals</span> in a game for the first time in his career,
            including an <span>eight-minute hat-trick,</span> in a 9-1 rout of Granada.
            His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2-0 win against
            <span>Rayo Vallecano.</span> Subsequent hat-tricks against <span>Sevilla,</span>
            <span>Espanyol</span> and <span>Getafe</span> took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31,
            surpassing <span>Di Stefano's</span> club record of 28.
            He finished the season with 48 goals,
            winning a second consecutive <span>Pichichi</span> and the <span>European Golden Shoe</span> for a record
            fourth time.

        <p>
            At the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015-16 campaign,
            Ronaldo became the <span>club's all-time top scorer,</span>
            first in the league and then in all competitions.
            Ronaldo also became the <span>all-time top scorer</span> in the
            <span>Champions League</span> with a hat-trick in the first group
            match against <span>Shakhtar Donetsk,</span> having finished the
            previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.
            Two goals against <span>Malmo FF</span> in a 2-0 away win on 30 September
            saw him reach the milestone of <span>500 career goals</span>
            for club and country. He subsequently became the first player
            to score double figures in the competition's group stage,
            setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against<span>Malmo FF.</span>
            For the <span>sixth successive year,</span>
            he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.
            For his efforts during the season, he received the
            <span> UEFA Best Player in Europe</span> Award for a second time.
            Ronaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016-17 season,
            including the <span>2016 UEFA Super Cup</span> against
            <span>Sevilla,</span> as he continued
            to rehabilitate the <span>knee injury</span>
            he suffered against France in the <span>Euro 2016 final.</span>
            On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against
            <span>Sporting CP</span> in the Champions League,
            with Ronaldo stating post match that <span>"they made me who I am"</span>
            On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his <span>500th club career goal</span>
            in the 2-0 win over <span>Club America</span> in the semi-finals of the
            <span>2016 FIFA Club World Cup.</span> He then scored a hat-trick in the 4-2 win over
            <span>Japanese club Kashima Antlers</span> in the final.
            Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals
            and was also named player of the tournament.
            He won the <span>2016 Ballon d'Or</span>, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016
            <span>The Best FIFA Men's Player,</span> a revival of the former
            FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success
            with Portugal in winning <span>Euro 2016.</span>

            In the <span>2016-17 UEFA Champions League</span>
            quarter-finals
            against <span>FC Bayern</span> in April,
            Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-1 away
            win which saw him make history by becoming
            the first player to reach
            <span>100 goals</span> in UEFA club competition.
            In the second leg of the quarter-finals,
            Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his
            <span>100th Champions League goal,</span>
            becoming the first player to do so as
            Madrid again defeated Bayern 4-2 after extra-time.
            On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated
            Atletico 3-0 in the Champions League semi-final first leg.
            On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook
            <span>Jimmy Greaves</span> as the
            all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues,
            scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.
            He finished the season with 42 goals in all
            competitions as he helped Madrid to win their
            <span>first La Liga title since 2012.</span>
            In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored
            two goals in a 4-1 victory over Juventus to take
            him to 12 goals for the season,
            making him the competition's top goalscorer for the
            sixth straight season,
            as well as the first player to score in three finals
            in the Champions League era; the second goal was
            the <span>600th</span> of his senior career.
            <span>
                Madrid also became the first team to win
                back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.

        <p>
            On 23 October, his performances throughout
            2017 saw him awarded
            <span>The Best FIFA Men's Player</span>
            award for the second consecutive year.
            On 6 December, he became the <span>first
                player to score</span> in all
            six Champions League group stage matches with a
            curling strike at home to Dortmund.
            A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or,
            receiving his
            <span>fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</span>
            On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner,
            as Madrid won their second <span>Club World Cup</span>
            in a row by beating <span>Gremio</span> in the final.
            On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in
            a 3-1 home win over <span>Getafe,</span> his first being
            his <span>300th La Liga goal</span> in his <span>286th appearance,</span>
            making him the fastest player to reach this
            landmark and only the second player to do so after <span>Messi.</span>
            On 18 March, he reached his <span>50th career
                hat-trick,</span> scoring four goals in a 6-3 win against <span>Girona.</span>
            On 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a
            3-0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals
            of the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League,
            with his second goal being an <span>acrobatic bicycle kick.</span>
            Described as a <span>"PlayStation goal"</span> by Juventus
            defender <span>Andrea Barzagli,</span> with Ronaldo's foot
            approximately <span>7 ft (2.31 m)</span> off the ground,
            it garnered him a standing ovation from
            the opposing fans in the stadium as well
            as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.
        </p>

        <img src="images/RM9.webp" title="Real Madrid" alt="Real Madrid">

        <p>
            On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus,
            a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3-1 defeat,
            meaning Madrid advanced 4-3 on aggregate.
            It was his tenth goal against <span>Juventus,</span>
            a Champions League record against a single club. In the final on 26 May,
            <span>Madrid</span> defeated <span>Liverpool</span> 3-1,
            winning Ronaldo his <span>fifth Champions League title,</span> the first player to do so.
            He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the
            <span>sixth consecutive season</span>
            with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense,
            sparking speculation that he could <span>leave the club.</span>
            He left without a <span>proper goodbye</span>, so madrid fan's are chanting "Ronaldo Ronaldo Ronaldo".

        <p>
            Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,
            on <span>10 July 2018,</span> Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with
            <span>Italian club Juventus</span>
            after completing a <span>€100 million transfer,</span>
            which included an additional <span>€12 million</span>
            in other fees and solidarity contributions to
            <span>Ronaldo's youth clubs.</span> The transfer was the
            highest ever for a player over <span>30 years old,</span>
            and the highest paid by an <span>Italian club.</span>
            On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3-2 away win against
            <span>Chievo Verona.</span> On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his
            first two goals for <span>Juventus</span>
            in his fourth appearance in a 2-1 home win over <span>Sassuolo</span>
            in Serie A; his second goal was the <span>400th league goal of his career.</span>
            On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus,
            against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for
            <span>"violent conduct",</span>

            became the first player in history to win
            <span>100 Champions League matches.</span>

            the 2018 <span>Supercoppa Italiana,</span>
            after he scored the only goal from a header against <span>AC Milan.</span>

            On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home win against
            <span>Atletico</span> in the second leg of the Champions
            League round of 16, helping Juventus
            overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.
            The following month, he scored his <span>125th goal in the
                competition,</span> opening the scoring in a
            1-1 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against
            <span>Ajax</span> on 10 April. In the second leg in
            <span>Turin</span> on 16 April, he scored the opening goal,
            but Juventus eventually lost the match 2-1 and were
            eliminated from the competition. On 20 April, Ronaldo
            played in the scudetto clinching game against <span>Fiorentina,</span>
            as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a
            2-1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win
            league titles in <span>England, Spain and Italy.</span>
            On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser
            in a 1-1 away draw against <span>Derby d'Italia</span> rivals <span>Inter Milan.</span>

                8 assists,</span> Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A
            award for <span>Most Valuable Player.</span>
            On 1 October, he reached several milestones in
            Juventus's 3-0 Champions League group stage win
            over <span>Bayer Leverkusen</span>: he scored in a
            <span>14th consecutive season,</span> equalling
            Raul and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas
            record for most Champions League wins of all time,
            and equalled Raul's record of scoring against
            <span>33 different opponents.</span>On 18 December,
            Ronaldo leapt to a height of <span>8 ft 5 in (2.57 m),</span>
            higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal
            in a 2-1 away win against <span>Sampdoria.</span>
            He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020,
            in a 4-0 home win against <span>Cagliari.</span>
            His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the
            second player after <span>Alexis Sanchez</span> to score hat-tricks
            in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On
            22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside <span>Gabriel
                Batistuta</span>
            and <span>Fabio Quagliarella,</span> in his <span>1,000th senior professional game,</span> a 2-1 away win
            against <span>SPAL.</span>
        </p>

        <img src="images/Juventes2.jpg" title="Juventus" alt="Juventus">

        <p>
            On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2-0 away win over <span>Bologna,</span> overtaking <span>Rui
                Costa</span> to become the highest scoring <span>Portuguese player</span>
            in <span>Serie A</span> history. On 4 July, he scored his <span>25th league goal</span> from a free kick in
            a 4-1 home win over rivals <span>Torino,</span>
            becoming the <span>first Juventus player</span> to achieve this milestone since <span>Omar Sivori</span> in
            1961.
            On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2-1 home win over <span>Lazio</span>; his first goal was his 50th in
            <span>Serie A.</span> He became the
            <span>second-fastest player</span> to reach this landmark, after <span>Gunnar Nordahl,</span> and the
            <span>first player</span> in history to reach
            50 goals in the <span>Premier League, La Liga and Serie A,</span> and becoming the second player after
            <span>Edin Dzeko</span> to score 50 goals in three of
            Europe's top five major leagues. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming
            just the third player
            (after <span>Felice Borel</span> in 1934 and <span>John Hansen</span> in 1952) in Juventus's history to
            reach that milestone in a season.
            Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of <span>35 years and 166 days,</span> to score over 30
            goals in one of the five top <span>European leagues</span>
            since <span>Ronnie Rooke</span> with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2-0
            home win over <span>Sampdoria</span> as Juventus were
            crowned <span>Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.</span> He finished his second league campaign
            with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the
            league behind only European Golden Shoe winner <span>Ciro Immobile,</span> with 36 goals. On 7 August,
            Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2-1 home win against
            <span>Lyon</span> in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season
            with <span>37 goals in all competitions;</span>
            the tally allowed him to break <span>Borel's club record</span> of 36 goals in a single season.
        </p>

        <img src="images/Seria A.jpg" title="Serie A" alt="Serie A">

        <p>
            On 2 March, he scored a goal in a 3-0 win over <span>Spezia</span> in his <span>600th league match,</span>
            to become the <span>first player</span> to score at
            least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the <span>top five leagues of Europe.</span> On 14 March, he
            scored his <span>57th career hat-trick</span>
            in a 3-1 away win over <span>Cagliari.</span> On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3-1 away win over
            <span>Sassuolo</span> to reach his 100th goal for
            Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the
            feat. With Juventus's victory in the
            <span>2021 Coppa Italia Final</span> on 19 May, Ronaldo became the <span>first player</span> in history to
            win every major domestic trophy in
            <span>England, Spain and Italy.</span> Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the
            <span>Capocannoniere</span> award for highest goalscorer and
            becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the <span>English, Spanish and Italian
                leagues.</span> On 26 August, Ronaldo leaves Juventes
            and it was confirmed that Juventes rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks
            to sign him, while former manager
            <span>Alex Ferguson</span> and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to
            <span>re-sign</span> for United.

            On <span>30 December 2022</span>, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club
            effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.
            As reported by <span>Fabrizio Romano</span> of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in
            history, worth <span>€200 million per year;</span>
            this included an annual guaranteed football salary of <span>€90 million,</span> with commercial and
            sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary
            to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of <span>€100 million.</span>
            According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to
            <span>Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City</span> to join Al Nassr.On <span>19 January,</span>
            Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to
            Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's <span>Al Nassr</span> and <span>Al
                Hilal</span> players against
            <span>Paris Saint-Germain(PSG).</span> Ronaldo scored twice in a <span>5-4 loss.</span>He made his debut for
            Al Nassr on <span>22 January,</span>

            spent another season without winning a league title,
            as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022-23 season.Ronaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in
            increased popularity both domestically and internationally
            of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as <span>Karim Benzema, Sadio Mane, N'Golo
                Kante, Ruben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino
                andNeymar</span> moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as

        <h2><span>Portugal</span></h2>

        <img src="images/Portugal.png" title="Portugal National Team" alt="Portugal National Team">

        <p>
            Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal <span>under-15 in 2001.</span> During his international
            youth career, Ronaldo would represent the
            under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring
            <span>18 goals overall.</span>Aged 18, Ronaldo made his
            <span>first senior appearance</span> for Portugal in a 1-0 win over <span>Kazakhstan</span> on 20 August
            2003, coming on as a half-time substitute for <span>Luis Figo.</span>
            Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with
            seven goals.At the age of <span>21 years and 132 days,</span>
            Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a <span>World Cup finals.</span>One day after
            turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the
            first time in a friendly game against <span>Brazil</span> on 6 February 2007, as requested by Portuguese
            Football Federation (FPF) president <span>Carlos Silva,</span>
            who had died two days earlier. Ahead of <span>Euro 2008,</span> he was given the <span>number 7</span> shirt for the
            first time.

        <p>
            After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, <span>Luiz Felipe Scolari</span> was replaced as
            coach by <span>Carlos Queiroz,</span> formerly the assistant
            manager at United. Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008. Ronaldo failed to score
            a single goal in the qualification for the <span>2010 World Cup,</span>
            as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over
            <span>Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span> In the group stage of
            the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against <span>Ivory Coast, North Korea
            and Brazil.</span> His only goal of the tournament came

            following a challenge from <span>Dimitri Payet,</span>

            <span>Quaresma.</span> During extra time, substitute <span>Eder</span>
            scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a <span>1-0 victory.</span> As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the
            trophy in celebration of his <span>country's first triumph </span>
            in a major tournament. He was awarded the <span>Silver Boot</span> as the joint second-highest goalscorer,
            with three goals and three assists,
            and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.Following the <span>Euro
            2016</span> success, Ronaldo played his first professional
            match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2-3 friendly defeat to
            <span>Sweden</span> at the <span>Estadio dos Barreiros.</span>

        <h3>His Rivalry</h3>

        <h2><span>Lionel Messi</span></h2>

        <p>

            <img src="images/Rivalry.jpg" title="Cristiano And Messi" alt="Cristiano And Messi">

            Both <span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span>
            and <span> Lionel Messi</span> have scored
            in multiple <span>UEFA Champions League finals</span>
            and have regularly broken the
            <span>50-goal barrier in a single season.</span>
            Sports journalists regularly weigh
            the individual merits of both players in an <span>attempt
                to argue</span> who they believe is the <span>best
                player in modern football</span>
            or in the <span>history of the game</span>.
            Part of the debate revolves around the
            contrasting <span>personalities</span> of the two players,
            as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an
            <span>arrogant and theatrical showoff,</span>
            while Messi is portrayed as a <span> shy, humble character.</span>
            In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry,
            saying: <span>"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition,
                this is why the competition is so high".</span>
            "Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time
            at Manchester United, opined: <span>
                "I don't think the
                rivalry against each other bothers them.
                I think they have their own personal
                pride in terms of wanting to be the best."
            </span>

        </p>

        <img src="images/Rivalry2.jpg" title="Cristiano And Messi" alt="Cristiano And Messi">

        <p>

            In <span>August 2019</span>, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while
            <span>sat next to each other</span> prior to the announcement
            of the <span>UEFA Men's Player of the Year,</span>
            with Ronaldo stating:
            <span>
                "I pushed him and he pushed me as well.
                So it's good to be part of the history of football."
            </span>
            In <span>September 2023</span>, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry
            with Messi was
            <span>
                "Over", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".
            </span>
            After Messi led Argentina to victory in the
            <span>2022 FIFA World Cup</span>,
            a number of football critics,
            commentators and players have opined
            that Messi has <span>settled the debate</span>
            between the two living legends.
